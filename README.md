# My entry for the 2024 BPHO computational challenge

This was my entry for the 2024 BPHO computational challenge, and it won gold! It completes all 12 challenges however I didnt have enough time to complete any bonus challenges, but it is a PWA!!

171 students entered and 65% won gold, including me.

This code was fully written by me and i am uploading it here (nearly a year later) to archive it. I might come back in the future and clean up the repo / add more comments but i won't change the code

## Demo

Here is a showcase of all the features that was submitted to the competition, the time limit was 2 minutes which is why it seems rushed.
